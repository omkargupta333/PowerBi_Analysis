Super Store Sales Analysis in PowerBi
Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the sales data of Super Store using various techniques such as time series analysis and sales forecasting. The primary goal is to gain insights into sales patterns, identify trends, and forecast future sales for a 15-day period.

Approach
To achieve the objective, the following approach was followed:

Data Gathering: The sales data of Super Store spanning a two-year period was collected. The dataset includes information on sales figures, dates, and other relevant variables.

Data Preprocessing: The collected data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting the data appropriately.

Time Series Analysis: The sales data was treated as a time series, where the sales figures are observed over time. Time series analysis techniques, such as decomposition, autocorrelation, and trend analysis, were applied to understand the underlying patterns and relationships.

Sales Forecasting: Based on the identified patterns and trends, a forecasting model was developed to predict future sales. Various forecasting methods, such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, or machine learning algorithms, were applied to generate accurate predictions,15-Day Sales Forecast: Using the developed forecasting model, sales were projected for a 15-day period. This forecast provides valuable insights for short-term planning, inventory management, and resource allocation.

Reporting and Visualization: The findings of the analysis, including the insights from time series analysis, sales forecasting, and the 15-day sales forecast, were presented using visualizations and reports. This enables stakeholders to easily interpret and utilize the information for decision-making.

This repository contains an analysis of Super Store sales data over a period of two years.
